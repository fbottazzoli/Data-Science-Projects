All groups and individual must do the following:
1. Convert the app sizes to a number
2. Convert the number of installs to a number
3. Transform “Varies with device” into a missing value
4. Convert Current Ver and Android Ver into a dotted number (e.g. 4.0.3 or 4.2)
5. Remove the duplicates
6. For each category, compute the number of apps
7. For each category, compute the average rating
8. Create two dataframes: one for the genres and one bridging apps and genres. So that, for instance, the app Pixel Draw - Number Art Coloring Book appears twice in the bridging table, once for Art & Design, once for Creativity
9. For each genre, create a new column of the original dataframe. The new columns must have boolean values (True if the app has a given genre)
10. For each genre, compute the average rating. What is the genre with highest average?
11. For each app, compute the approximate income, obtain as a product of number of installs and price.
12. For each app, compute its minimum and maximum Sentiment_polarity
